webgl_playground
================

A simple WebGL playground. Built as an Angular app on top of a static Jekyll site using slim for templating and coffeescript for the js.

The idea is a scene with a floor. You can render primitives by clicking the buttons on the left panel, then edit the position/rotation/name/scale/shading of each object by clicking on it's tag on the right panel. 

To set up first do a `bundle install`, then execute the server with `bundle exec jekyll server` and visit http://localhost:4000
